            You know that feeling when someone is staring at you for a really
            long time? It’s super uncomfortable right? Especially if this gaze
            is unreciprocated. Glance Back grew out of a desire to recognize
            that this phenomenon occurs between ourselves and our machines when
            we spend so much time looking at our screen. <br />
            <br />
            With this chrome extension, once a day at random when you open a new
            tab, Glance Back will quickly snap a photo of you and inquire: “What
            are you thinking about?”. Once you type your answer and press enter,
            the photo and thought will be collectively saved to your history of
            glances, cumulatively creating an archive of moments you share with
            your screen. Given that most of the digital photos we generate of
            ourselves today are highly curated (i.e. <i> wait let me fix my hair and
            smile and please take at least 10 photos just to make sure there’s a
            good one!</i>), Glance Back also acts as an antidote to this attitude by
            providing you with unexpected and often… unflattering… photos of
            yourself. <br />
            <br />

            It’s important to note that all of the photos are saved to your
            browser’s local storage. This means that they never leave your
            machine. This is a collection shared purely between you and your
            computer. If you want the photos for yourself, you can choose to
            download them under the settings tab in the top right. You can also
            delete photos from the archive and choose whether the extension
            requires you to write a caption or not. <br />
            <br />
            When using our devices, we’re pulled into and solely focused on the
            glowing world that exists on the screen. We lose both an awareness
            of self and of the real world context surrounding us. This extension
            aims to disrupt that trance and remind you that you are here and
            your computer is there and you are just staring at it and... wow is that
            really what I look like right now?<br />
