          Q: My camera is not working... it says there is an error accessing the readable stream or it seems to be
          using snap camera, etc. How do I fix this?
        </p>
        <br>
        <p class="answer">A: Try going to <span
            href="chrome://settings/content/camera?search=camera">chrome://settings/content/camera?search=camera</span>
          in your Chrome browser you
          should see an
          option to select your default camera (see the screenshot below). Then, you should hopefully be able to
          select which camera you would like the extension to use. My default on a Macbook, the one I want Glance Back
          to use, is the FaceTime HD Camera.</p>

          Q: Why has it not taken any photos yet?
        </p>
        <br>
        <p class="answer">A: Glance Back takes a photo once a day at random when you open a new tab, but there may be some days that it never takes a photo. If you just installed the extension, give it at least a week and make sure you are opening new tabs every day. It may be that the timing is not working out, and you and Glance Back keep having missed connections : ( Otherwise, not sure why!!!!!</p>
